When one of your clients places an order through your e-commerce store, the order is directly created, based on the given informations, in Evoliz. The synchronization is made directly, without any manipulation from your side.
If the client (and/or the client contact) does not already exist in your Evoliz account, the information provided will be used to create a new record in Evoliz.
